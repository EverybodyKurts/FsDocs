# FsDocs

A repository where I can create simple F# examples, patterns, and maybe some helper functions - mainly for myself. I plan to "borrow" shamelessly from Elm docs, F# for Fun and Profit, and any other piece of literature I find enlightening.

I also plan to create functions based of Ruby's enumerable libs and Elm's libs whenever I find helpful functions missing.

## Todos

[ ] Demo mapping functions (e.g. Mass.map add)
